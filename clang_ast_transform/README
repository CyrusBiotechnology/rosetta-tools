This is a clang tool to refactor the Rosetta codebase. It uses the clang AST
matchers to find nodes in the AST and rewrites them. Tested with clang 3.5
(essentially trunk).

*** This is work in progress. ***

SETUP:

Get the llvm and clang sources per the instructions on their website.
Copy rosetta-refactor-tool to the extra tools directory, like:

	$LLVM_SRC/tools/clang/tools/extra/rosetta-refactor-tool/
	
Add rosetta-refactor-tool to the $LLVM_SRC/tools/clang/tools/extra/CMakeList.txt
file:

	add_subdirectory(rosetta-refactor-tool)
	
Build with whatever means (make, cmake, ninja). You should end up
with a binary: build/bin/rosetta-refactor-tool


RUNNING:

./rewrite_all.sh path/to/rosetta/source/file.cc

like:
./rewrite_all.sh src/numeric/expression_parser/Arithmetic.cc

See verbose and readonly flags in the RosettaRefactorTool.cpp file.

Running on all files:

ME=$PWD
ROOT=/data/rosetta
SRC=$ROOT/main/source/src
export PYTHONPATH=$ROOT/tools/python_cc_reader

cd $SRC
python $ME/run_on_all_files_w_fork.py -e $ME/rewrite_all.sh -n 8
