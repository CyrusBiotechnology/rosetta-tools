PDB manipulations:

The argument usage for these scripts can be found by running the
scripts with no arguments.

* addChain.pl:  add a new chain to a pdb file that previously did not
  have one 

* extractChains.pl:  extract given chains from a pdb file,
  followed by a TER.  You can extract multiple chains at once, but
  there will be only one TER at the end.

* changeChain.pl:  change a the chainID of a given chain.

* listChains.pl:  list chains in a pdb file, with the position of
  existing TERs marked by a '-' after the appropriate chain. 

* openPDB.pl:  Separate two docking partners (delimited by TERs) along
  the line of centers by a given distance. 

* pdb_detail.pl:  Breaks pdb file down completely by chains and
  residue numbers.

* pdb_fasta.pl:  Generate a FASTA format sequence file from a pdb.

* pdb_remove_missing_bb.bl:  remove missing backbone atoms from a
  pdb.  Missing backbone atoms in a pdb will cause Rosetta to crash.

* renumberPDB.pl:  change the numbering in a pdb, starting over at
  TERs.  Warning:  discontinuous numbering (e.g. chain breaks) will
  become continuous.

* translate_xyz.pl:  translate given chain of a pdb file by given
  deltaX, deltaY, and deltaZ.

* truncate.pl:  truncate a given chain of a pdb before or after a
  given residue number.

* zapHs.pl:  Removes hydrogens from a pdb (usually to remove Hs that
  Rosetta has inserted).

Disulfides:

* makefixdisulf.py:  python script to make .fixdisulf files for using
  -fix_disulf option in RosettaDock

* calccontacts.py, coordlib.py, and loadPDB.py are python scripts upon which
  makefixdisulf.py depends.  do not remove them.   

More:

* zapChain.pl - remove a chain from a pdb file
 
* pdb_sequence.pl - extract the sequence from the pdb

* pdb_add_insert_codes.pl - add insert letters to repeated pdb residue
  numbers

* orientPDB.pl - rotate the PDB based on a particular residue

* renumberPDBandchains.pl - starts each chain numbering at res 1

* renumberPDBatoms.pl - renumber the atoms from 1

* homogenizeChain.pl - identifies all ATOMs with given chain and
  removes TERs

* pdb_subtract_scores.pl - Compare scores residue by residue

* pdb_only_ATOM_TER.pl - remove everything from file except ATOM and
  TER lines

* truncateFABs.pl [-LH|-H] [-truncL x] [-truncH x] 
	Truncate light chain L at 112 and heavy chain H at 119
