# RScripts Directory
## JRJ 2015.12.09

Adding readme since there was not one beforehand.
Looks to be primarily composed of old scripts written/modified by Jeff.

Enumeration of Scripts

* do_fit.R: Sources (loads) jfit_coef.R, jE.R, and jz.R, then fits data with glm.

* do_fit_FA.R: Sources (loads) jfit_coef.R, jE.R, and jz.R, then fits data with glm.

* do_fit_bumpcut.R: Cuts out "bumpy" models and then does same as do_fit_FA.R.

* do_fit_centroid.R: Sources (loads) jfit_coef.R, jE.R, and jz.R, then fits centroid data with glm.

* do_fit_elec.R: Sources (loads) jfit_coef.R, jE.R, and jz.R then fits electrostatic data with glm.

* do_just_score_plot.R: Sources (loads) jplots.R and plots scores of filtered data.

* do_score4d_plots.R: Sources (loads) jplots.R and calculates a combined score and plots.

* do_score_plots.R: Sources (loads) jplots.R and plots data.

* do_target_and_score_plots.R: Sources (loads) jplots.R and plots data.

* do_target_plots.R: Sources (loads) jplots and plots data.

* init.R: Source jplots.R and plots scores. Sources jfit_coef.R and makes glm models.

* jE.R: Looks to calculate enrichment.

* jfit_coef.R: ???

* jplots.R: Looks to load score files from directory (if not already loaded).
            Generates list of score terms (fullatom or centroid).
            Makes numerous plots.

* jz.R: Looks to calculate z-scores.
