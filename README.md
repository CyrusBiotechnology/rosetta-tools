Rosetta Tools
=============

Rosetta tools contains a number of utilities to facilitate Rosetta development including tools for C++ parsing, header only compilation and measuring test coverage.  Somewhat mysteriously, this repository also contains scripts to run particular Rosetta applications including ERRASER and fragment picking.
