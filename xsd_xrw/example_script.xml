 This purpose of this "script" is to show off the aspects of RosettaScripts that are
 changing with the XSD update. Run the rewrite_rosetta_script.py script on this file
 with the following comamnd line:
 > python rewrite_rosetta_script.py --input example_script.xml --output example_script_rewritten.xml
 and then diff the two files:
 > diff example_script.xml example_script_rewritten.xml
 and you will see what kinds of things changed.

 The first thing that changes is that the root tag needs to be ROSETTASCRIPTS and not dock_design
 and it has to be the very first thing in the file.

  Here is a comment to make sure that
  we handle comments ok

    This next tag has whitespace between the slash and the greater-than sign. What garbage!
