 This purpose of this "script" is to show off the aspects of RosettaScripts that are
 changing with the XSD update. Run the rewrite_rosetta_script.py script on this file
 with the following comamnd line:
 > python rewrite_rosetta_script.py --input example_script.xml --output example_script_rewritten.xml
 and then diff the two files:
 > diff example_script.xml example_script_rewritten.xml
 and you will see what kinds of things changed.

 The first thing that changes is that the root tag needs to be ROSETTASCRIPTS and not dock_design
 and it has to be the very first thing in the file.

  Here is a comment to make sure that
  we handle comments ok
  <!-- and here is a block comment, to make sure we get those right too -->

    This next tag has whitespace between the slash and the greater-than sign. What garbage!

    Someone thought it would be really cute if they created a subtag that held the attributes of arbitrary movers.
    Instead, the common subtag should have a bunch of subtags of its own with two attributes "attr" and "value"
    and these will be composed to create the Tag that will be parsed by the ThermodynamicMover that the
    ModulatedMover will contain. Look, it's not a good system.
    <common ref="P.pdb" restrict=1 restrict_trans=20 restrict_rot=90 />
    <Interp key="rot_mag" curve="exponential"  start=15 end=1/>
    <Interp key="trans_mag" curve="exponential"  start=1.5 end=0.1/>

  Below is a Tag where there is a space between the opening less than sign and the element name
  Taken from the ideal_proteins demo
