This script check_logs.py, along with the Rosetta application PDB_diagnostic, is used to determine what PDBs Rosetta has problems reading.  PDB_diagnostic is intended to be run against the entire PDB dataset (all 116K+ PDBs).  The log files are then concatenated and fed through check_logs.py.  The script parses the log file to determine which PDBs had errors, and can classify more than 20 of those errors.  Contact Steven Lewis, smlewi@gmail.com, for support.  Will Hansen wrote much of the script.
